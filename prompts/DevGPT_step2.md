Thank you! Please create a high-level plan for the implementation:

- For each milestone, start by creating a source file list. This is a list the source files that should be created, and the names of the functions and classes in every source file.
- Below this, write down a high-level implementation plan for every function and class in the source file list.

I will review the high-level plan. We will iterate on this until the high-level plan is clear and looking good.
