Let's continue with the following work-flow:

1. For each source file in each milestone in the high-level plan, I will ask you to write the code for that file. You don't need to explain the code, unless if I ask you to do so.
2. I will give feedback on the code.
3. We iterate on steps 1 and 2 until the code is looking good. Then we proceed to the next source file.
4. We iterate until we have the source code for every file in the milestone. Then we proceed to the next milestone.

Please try to follow the guidelines for writing source code as much as possible. In cases where it might be surprising that a particular guideline was not followed, then please tell me why it wasn't followed.

Please start by writing the code for Deck.ts, and assume that we'll use src/decks/components/Deck.ts as the file location.
